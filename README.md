# Beyond Binary AI

Beyond Binary AI is a JavaScript application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate text in a variety of contexts. 
The goal of this project is to fine-tune the model on queer and LGBTIQ+ topics, and eventually create a model that works well with questions related 
to gender identity and expression.

## Getting Started
To use Beyond Binary AI, you'll need to have an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for one on the OpenAI website.
Once you have your API key, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. Then, create a .env file with your API key: ``` OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here ```


Next, install the required dependencies:
```npm install```

Finally, start the application:
```npm start```

## Usage
Once the application is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You'll see a text input box where you can enter a prompt for the GPT-3 model to complete.

Choose a model from the dropdown menu and select the parameters you'd like to use. Then, click the "Generate Text" button to see the results.
